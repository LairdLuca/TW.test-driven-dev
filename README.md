# Test-Driven Development with .NET 9

This repository contains exercises and examples completed during the Udemy course **[Test Driven Development in ASP.NET Core - The Handbook](https://www.udemy.com/course/test-driven-development-in-net-core-the-handbook/)** by Trevoir Williams. This repository showcases implementations using **.NET 9**.

## Course Overview

The course covers fundamental and advanced concepts of Test-Driven Development (TDD), providing practical experience in writing clean, maintainable, and robust code using TDD principles in .NET applications.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- **TDD Fundamentals:** Understanding the cycle of Red, Green, Refactor.
- **xUnit:** Writing and structuring effective unit tests.
- **Shouldly:** Enhancing readability and clarity of assertions.
- **Moq:** Mocking dependencies and isolating units of code.
- Writing maintainable and testable code.

### Technologies Used:
- **.NET 9**
- **xUnit**
- **Shouldly**
- **Moq**

### GitHub Workflow
The course also includes a section demonstrating how to set up a GitHub Action workflow to automatically build and run unit tests when pushing code to GitHub. The workflow helps ensure continuous integration (CI) and immediate feedback on code changes.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)** with GitHub Actions.
- Automated build and testing pipeline.

## Repository Structure
The repository includes exercises and examples demonstrating the use of TDD to achieve reliable and well-structured code.
